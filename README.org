* I am a faker
  I use the arrow key's a LOT. (even after a decade of emacs)
  This is as we all know a big no no.
  I can try to explain it away whit the fact that I was introduced to the hovly land
  after the keyboards all had arrow keys. But I have seen the xkcd and read the posts.
  so this is me hiding my dependency on the arrows(and it was fun to see how this should be done).

* the keys
  i: up
  j: left
  k: down
  l: right

  there is more and I'll add it here later. but you should not use this as it is only an attempt
  on customization for the sake of trying it
